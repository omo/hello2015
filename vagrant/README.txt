# Setup Vagrant

 * Install Vagrant (Ensure it is newest. Older ones don't support Vagrant Cloud)
 * Install/Update VirtualBox (Vagrant seems it being up-to-date.)
 * `vagrant init ubntu/trusty64`
   * https://vagrantcloud.com/ubuntu/trusty64
 * `vagrant up`

See exisint VMs (not "box"es. They are install images, not VM disks.)

 * `vagrant global-status`
